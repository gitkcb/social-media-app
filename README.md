# social-media-app

github repo: https://github.com/gitkcb/social-media-app

## Description

This is a back-end of a social media app that allows all users to be fetched, a single user to be fetched, as well as to update and delete a user. This back-end also has the capability of a user adding a thought, adding a friend to a user, and users reacting to others thoughts. This project is the base of a social media app where a user would easily be able to keep in touch with friends over the internet. I learned how to use the mongoose package with MongoDB a NoSQL database.
